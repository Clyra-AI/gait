# Gait Product Summary

Gait is an execution-boundary control and evidence substrate for production AI agents.

It provides four OSS primitives:

1. Runpack: capture signed, deterministic artifacts from agent runs.
2. Regress: convert incidents into deterministic CI checks.
3. Gate: evaluate structured tool-call intent with fail-closed policy outcomes.
4. Doctor: diagnose first-run environment issues with stable JSON output.

Gait is vendor-neutral and offline-first for core workflows.
