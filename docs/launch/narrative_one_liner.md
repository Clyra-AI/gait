# Narrative One-Liners

Use one primary line and one supporting line. Do not switch category language mid-launch.

## Core Category Line

Gait is the offline-first Agent Control Plane for production tool actions.

## Product Promise Line

Turn any agent incident into a verifiable artifact, a policy decision, and a deterministic CI regression.

## Audience Variants

Platform engineering:

- Control agent tool execution at the boundary, not after the fact.

Security:

- Enforce least-privilege policy on tool calls with signed, auditable traces.

Developer:

- `gait demo` to deterministic regressions in minutes, with no hosted dependency.

Compliance:

- Evidence packs and stable schemas designed for tickets, audits, and change control.

## Hard Boundaries (must stay explicit)

- Not an agent builder or orchestrator.
- Not prompt-only filtering.
- Not a hosted governance dashboard requirement.
